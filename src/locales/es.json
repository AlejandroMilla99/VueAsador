    "description": "I am Alejandro Milla Ramírez, I was born in Málaga and since I was a child I have been interested in the world of computers and the Internet, making them part of my hobbies. That is why, later, I decided to study a double degree in Computer Engineering and Business Management at Universidad Complutense in Madrid. During my degree I realized that programming aroused great interest in me, leading me to research new technologies to create intuitive and efficient solutions. With experience in mobile and web application development, I specialize in building attractive and functional interfaces using modern technologies such as React, Swift and Python, with which I currently develop my work life.",
